# Amazon-Best-Sellers-Analysis
As a data analyst at Amazon and our manager has asked us to analyze some data. She has provided the following set of questions she would like answered.

## Questions:
- Is there any missing data?
- Are there any duplicates?
- Are there any spelling errors in the Name column?
- Create a plot showing the top 10 authors by rating.
- Create a pie chart showing the distribution of book genre.
- Create a plot showing the top 5 books by number of reviews.
- Are there any outliers?
- Create your own question and answer it.

I have done this project in Microsoft Power BI.

## Insights:
ðŸ‘‰ "The Fault in Our Stars" emerges as the book with the highest number of reviews, indicating its significant popularity among readers.

ðŸ‘‰ Emily Winfield Martin, despite having an average rating of 4.9, stands out as the author with the most reviews. Her books have garnered substantial attention and feedback from readers.

ðŸ‘‰ Non-fiction genre books constitute approximately 56% of the total books in the dataset, reflecting a significant presence of informative and factual literature.

ðŸ‘‰ On average, non-fiction books command a higher price compared to fiction books. In the year 2014, non-fiction books reached their peak average price of $20.81, indicating their perceived value and potentially higher production costs.

ðŸ‘‰ In the year 2019, there exists a relatively minimal average price difference of $1.22 between fiction and non-fiction books, suggesting a comparable pricing landscape for both genres during that particular year.

ðŸ‘‰ The majority of books fall within the price range of less than $30, indicating that most products are priced affordably for customers.

ðŸ‘‰ A scatter plot depicting the relationship between price and rating shows a positive correlation, suggesting that as prices increase, higher ratings are more likely. This correlation indicates that customers are generally willing to pay more for books with better ratings.
